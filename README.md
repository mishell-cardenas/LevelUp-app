## 🎯 Project Objective
LevelUp is a web application designed to solve common challenges faced by modern gamers, such as managing  backlogs, deciding what to play next, tracking progress across multiple stages of a game, and finding meaningful, trustworthy reviews. 

With digital game libraries growing rapidly and recommendations often scattered across platforms, players frequently struggle to stay organized and make informed decisions. LevelUp centralizes these needs by allowing users to discover video games, share ratings and written reviews, record play sessions, and manage a personalized game library. Core features include organizing games by status (e.g., playing, completed, dropped, backlog), logging hours and session details, and browsing community reviews. By combining discovery, tracking, and community interaction into a single platform, LevelUp transforms fragmented gaming workflows into a streamlined and personalized experience.

LevelUp was built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and vanilla JavaScript to offer users a smooth, interactive experience that efficiently manages game data, reviews, and personal library updates in real time.
